# Game character cards

The application generates 10 character cards from the template file.

This application relies on certain libraries that might not be supported in all environments. Therefore, I recommend viewing the functioning application at https://replit.com/@StanislavaNikul/Cards#main.py


After running the project, a folder containing 10 unique cards will be created. These cards can be found in the "cards" directory.
The cards are generated based on the template from the "template.svg" file.
